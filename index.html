          <p>Hello. My name is Adrian Kyzer and thank you for visiting my site. I am a hairstylist who is currently working to become a full stack web developer at the George Washington University School for Professional Studies. After nearly twenty years in the creative field of cosmetology, I am excited to expand that creativity into to world of technology. As someone who has always been interested in design and esthetics, and have always excelled in math and science, I looking forward to the marriage of the two hemispheres of my brain.</p>
          <p>As a hair designer, I had always incorporated various technology and social media to help expand my business. Some examples are learning HTML (in the early years) to create a static website of information about my background, work hours, and a few pictures of my work. I also learned to use Microsoft Publisher, Adobe InDesign, and Adobe Photoshop to create and online presence as well as print and digital advertising, marketing and promotional materials.</p>
          <p>As a web developer, I come into the field with a magnitude of skill acquired from my previous professions, such as, a keen eye for esthetics and details, and ability to perform individually and as a team. Having multiple clients per day, allows me to really be able to connect and communicate with people. The beauty professions is constantly evolving. Fads come and go, so I have always had to be able to learn new styles and techniques. Itâ€™s that desire to constantly learn new things and improve on my craft is, I think, sets me apart.</p>
